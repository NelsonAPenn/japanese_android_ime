# Japanese Android IME

A FOSS Japanese IME for Android.

The goal of this project is to become the de-facto standard for Japanese input on custom Android ROMs (and be a competitive option on stock Android).

Features and considerations:

- **Fully FOSS:** Released under a GPL v3.0 copyleft license.
- **Privacy-oriented:** Zero tracking, no phone home.
- **Actively maintained:** .
- **No upstream:** All the code for this project lies here. Every line of code is written with this IME in mind. There is no upstream to block (or provide) features.

This project was created because the Mozc Android IME is no longer maintained. Custom Android ROMs, past a certain Android version, have no options for Japanese input.

## Roadmap

1. 12-key input
2. Conversion to kanji using free data sources.
3. Radical input
4. Romaji input
5. Non-essentials (emoji, etc.)

In order to provide an extremely stable, functional product, **quashing bugs and unintended behavior will be heavily prioritized over new features**.
